            answer: 'Since you are in a double degree programme, you effectively belong to 2 faculties. You may choose which orientation you want to go for. Or you may choose to attend half of each orientation. How you would like to arrange your time is entirely up to yo'

            '1. You did not key in the NTU email (xxx@e.ntu.edu.sg), but instead typed in your own personal email. If that is the case, please fill in the form again and you should receive a confirmation email. If you still do not receive the confirmation, do send an email to cse-top@e.ntu.edu.sg to check for confirmation. \n\n' +
            '2. You keyed in the NTU email but are not considered an SCSE student. This would apply mainly to double major students whose main faculty isnâ€™t SCSE but signed up for the SCSE camp. If this is the case, please do find out which faculty is your main faculty and sign up for orientation in your main faculty\n\n' +
            '3. You keyed in your NTU email and is an SCSE student but did not receive a confirmation. If this is the case you might want to wait for about 2-3 working days as this might be caused by lag in the system. If you still did not receive an email confirmation, then do send an email to cse-top@e.ntu.edu.sg to check for confirmation.'
